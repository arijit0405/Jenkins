Title: CI Pipeline with Jenkins and GitHub Pull Request Automation

Project Goal:
------------
Build a complete CI pipeline using Jenkins that:
1. Automatically triggers a build on code push to 'feature1' branch.
2. Runs a Python application and its unit tests.
3. Creates a pull request (PR) from 'feature1' to 'main' on successful build.

Project Structure:
------------------
GitHub Repo: arijit0405/jenkins
Folder: simple_jenkins_pipeline/
Files:
  - app.py         : Sample Python application.
  - app_test.py    : Unit test script for the application.
  - Jenkinsfile    : Jenkins pipeline file (moved into the simple_jenkins_pipeline/ folder).

Steps Performed:
----------------
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Installed Jenkins locally on Windows.
   - Installed Python 3.13.3 on system.
   - Configured GitHub credentials in Jenkins as "Secret Text" with ID: `github-token`.

2. **Jenkins Pipeline Logic (Jenkinsfile)**

   Stages:
   a. Checkout Code
      - Pulls the latest code from GitHub.
   b. Run App
      - Runs the Python script: `app.py`
   c. Run Unit Tests
      - Runs `app_test.py` to validate application logic.

   Post-Build:
   - If all stages succeed, a GitHub API call using curl is made to create a PR:
     - Source: `feature1`
     - Target: `main`

3. **GitHub Webhook Setup**
   - Added a webhook in GitHub:
     - Payload URL: http://<your_public_jenkins_url>/github-webhook/
     - Content type: application/json
     - Trigger on: push

4. **Jenkins Project Setup**
   - Configured a pipeline job:
     - Source: GitHub repository
     - Branch: `feature1`
     - Script Path: `simple_jenkins_pipeline/Jenkinsfile`
     - Trigger: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

5. **Testing**
   - Pushed code to `feature1` â†’ Jenkins automatically triggered a build.
   - App and tests ran successfully.
   - Jenkins created a pull request to `main` using GitHub API.


Conclusion:
-----------
Successfully implemented a Jenkins CI pipeline that integrates with GitHub and automates pull request creation from a feature branch to the main branch upon passing builds.
